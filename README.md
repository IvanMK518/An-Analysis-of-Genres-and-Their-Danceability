“We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once.”
― Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche

Dancing is something that comes naturally to our body, and it's hard to imagine, at least sometimes, dancing without the accompany of music. Therefore, it is natural to wonder the relationship between music and dancing. In other words, what features of a song add to its danceability? To transform the vaguely defined and measured "danceability" into more tangible terms like "instrumentality," "loudness," etc., this repository aims to identify a few noticeable correlations between danceability of a song with other features.

To give you an overview of the content this repository contains, you can find the dataset of which we have based our analysis on, a renv file which allows you to replicate the computing environment we have created, and most importantly, two versions of code notebooks which contain all our codes,  analysis, and the conclusions we have reached in regards of the relationship between the different features of a song and its danceability.

In the end, we have find some common correlations, including but not limited to that low instrumentality, high feeling, and high loudness usually is correlated with higher danceability. Please feel free to read on and continue building on our analysis so that the next time you feel like dancing, you know what music to look for.
